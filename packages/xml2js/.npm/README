This directory and the contained npm-shrinkwrap.json file are automatically
generated when you change this package's npm dependencies. Commit this
directory and the npm-shrinkwrap.json file to source control so that
others run the same versions of sub-dependencies.

Note the .gitignore in this directory is configured to ignore the
node_modules sub-directory that meteor automatically creates.
